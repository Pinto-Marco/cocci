      Cocci Archivio was launched in 2021 with the goal of researching and
      selecting the finest vintage garments from every corner of the world.
    </p>

    <p>
      Showcasing the history of clothing is perhaps at the core of Cocci's
      attention, in fact every single garment is one of a kind and has a story
      to tell, a past that is sometimes visible on the material itself and that
      tells about its previous uses: the signs of time in this sense enrich the
      garment, giving it a uniqueness that only vintage pieces can have. The
      ethics of vintage is to value time, people and quality without embracing
      the fast-fashion culture.
    </p>

    <p>
      We have digitized over 1,500 garments across a wide range of categories,
      including military, denim, collegiate, workwear, leather, and many more.
      The archive is constantly growing, with new additions made daily.
    </p>

    <p>
      Located in the nearby of Bologna (ITA), the showroom direction is operated
      by founder Giulio Marchioni.
